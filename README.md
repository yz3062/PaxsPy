# PaxsPy
This software calculates protactinium excess, a proxy for ocean sediments usually used in conjunction with thorium excess, from ICP mass spectrometer results of uranium, thorium, and protactinium isotopes. It has a sister project, [ThxsPy](https://github.com/yz3062/ThxsPy), that calculates thorium excess.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

If you're new to python, I recommend you simply download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/), which includes all the prerequisites. Alternatively, download the followings individually:

Python 2

[scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)

[numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)

[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

### Installing

Click "Clone or download" on top right -> "Download ZIP". Unzip all files.

## Running the tests

Open Command Prompt in Windows or Terminal in MacOS, change to the directory where ThxsPy.py exsits, and type
```
python PaxsPy.py
```
When prompted to find input files, select all the files in the "Data" folder.
